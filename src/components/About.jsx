            Hello! My name is Oluwatimilehin and I enjoy creating things that
            live on the internet. My interest in web development started back in
            2020 when I decided to see how a web page is built by looking at the
            developers console and that taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!
          </p>

          <p>
            Fast-forward to today, and Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working as a
            freelancer for a start-up on <span>Upwork</span>. My main focus
            these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital
            experiences at <span>Bridge360</span> for a variety of clients.
          </p>

          <p>Here are a few technologies I'm currently working with:</p>
