## Portfolio Website v1

[Live Site](https://oluwatimilehin.onrender.com)

This application was built using React and as inpispired by [Brittany Chiang](https://github.com/bchiang7).

As this is my first ever portfolio website, I'll proceed by creating some newer versions with some bunch of new features as time permits.
